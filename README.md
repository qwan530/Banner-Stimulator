#  My Personal Project

## A Gacha Game Simulator

- **What will the application do?**

  This is a simulator of banners in gacha games. The users can use this application to simulate the situation if they 
pull in the inserted banner. They can decide whether they will pull or not in the actual game.


- **Who will use it?**

  The main users of this application will be the players of gacha games who are intended to pull in some banner but
hesitate to do it.


- **Why this project interested me?**

  I often play gacha games, and planning about using resources for banners is essential. Sometimes I put too many
  resources in one banner and, therefore unable to get my favourite character from another banner. Consequently, I wanted to
  design an application to help me better distribute my resources in the game.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a banner that I want to stimulate.

- As a user, I want to be able to add and delete characters to the banner.

- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of characters in the banner.

- As a user, I want to be able to pull from the banner and see the results.

- As a user, I want to be able to save my banner to file.

- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my banner from file

## Phase 4: Task 3

If I had more time to work on the project, I would make an interface for the buttons in the GUI. For now, they are
independent classes with very similar codes. It will be better if there is an interface that all the buttons implement.
