## A Gacha Game Simulator

- What will the application do?

  This is a simulator of banners in gacha games. The users can use this application to simulate the situation if they 
pull in the inserted banner. They can decide whether they will pull or not in the actual game.


- Who will use it?

  The main users of this application will be the players of gacha games who are intended to pull in some banner but
hesitate to do it.


- Why this project interested me?

  I often play gacha games, and planning about using resources for banners is essential. Sometimes I put too many
  resources in one banner and, therefore unable to get my favourite character from another banner. Consequently, I wanted to
  design an application to help me better distribute my resources in the game.
